# Auto Accept Own Task In Vehicle
Automatically accept a task that was created by you while in a vehicle.

### Summary
The true purpose of this script to make it slightly easier for shrikers to waypoint items of interest as they're strafing the map. Currently, when you're shriking, if you want to waypoint something you need to:
1. Go into CC
2. Right click on your object of interest
3. Select any of the options in the right click menu.
4. Exit out of CC
5. Type VCA or press the enter key to create a waypoint for that item.

You need to do all of the above while avoiding anything that might want to shoot you down (or running into the ground). This can also be  useful for bomber crews as well.

Unfortunately, there's not good way to automate 1) through 4). T2 only provides useful information to the client after you've created the potential waypoint action (option 3). 

The one thing that can be automated is 5). It may not make much of an impact, but it's one less annoyance to worry about. The following are important to know regarding this script's functionality:
1. This script will *only* automatically accept waypoints that *you* create while you are *flying in a vehicle*.
2. This script will *not* automatically accept waypoints that you create while you are *not* in a vehicle.
3. This script will *not* automatically accept waypoints that anyone else creates under any other contexts.
